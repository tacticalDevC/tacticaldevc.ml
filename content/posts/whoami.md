## tacticaldevc@your-network:~$ whois tacticalDevC

Hey there,

This should just be a article about me. It should help you people to understand who I am and what I am doing.

## tacticaldevc@your-network:~$ dig tacticalDevC

Well I am a student. Judge me for that or not. Currently I am attending a school in Vienna called Spengergasse. It might be well known for people who live in the EU or Austria. For those who don't know what this school is about: It is primarily an IT school but there are other branches too like biomedicine or industrial engineering. I don't want to go any further as I would like to stay more or less anonymous. I know, I know I already compromised my own anonymity but you can research me on the internet if you are really that curious ;)

In my free time I program apps (see my [github](https://github.com/tacticalDevC)) or try to hack around. I am constantly learning new things from the cyberverse that I try to implement in my home network (eg Pi-hole). On of my greatest ideas so far were the [PanicTrigger](https://github.com/tacticalDevC/PanicTrigger.git). Another project which is currently in development is [O.A.T.](https://github.com/tacticalDevC/OAT.git). My intention is to program apps that I haven't seen in public in any relateable form. 

I won't say I am new to the topics I care about but I still have to grow.

## tacticaldevc@your-network:~$ which tacticaldevc.ml

I already wrote a short summary what this blog is going to be about but I want to define it more concrete here.

First of all: Privacy! Privacy is a human right. Private data is private data. No company or organization should ever have access to this kind of data, neither in encrypted form nor in plaintext. Privacy is a big topic for me. So there will be posts about it (maybe the next post). 

Another topic is cybersecurity. If I find a vulnerability I will post it here (after responsible disclosure).

As I am a programmer too there will be notifications about development progress and releases.

## tacticaldevc@your-network:~$ exit

I hope I could give you some insight into what I am doing. Feel free to contact me. This can be done with the social links on the left or via my [public key](../../pub.asc).
