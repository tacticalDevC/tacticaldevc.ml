# Introduction
Today I searched for a new domain name registrar for my blog domain. What I found is "Orange". They seemed trustworthy. I cross-checked them with [privacytools.io](https://privacytools.io). I thought "okay well why not". But after a way too fast click on that buy button (shame on me) I researched a bit about this company which claims to be privacy-focused and 100% Icelandic.

See for yourself!

## Wait what is this even about?
A domain registrar!
